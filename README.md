## Description
Fakebook is a social media-inspired web application where users can share posts, including text and images. This project demonstrates a structured approach to user interactions, object-oriented JavaScript, and DOM manipulation for a dynamic, interactive user experience.

## Features
- **User Posting:** Users can create posts with text, images, or both.
- **User Account Info Modal:** Displays user details in a pop-up modal.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implements two main classes:
  - `User`: Manages user details such as `id`, `name`, `userName`, and `email`.
  - `Subscriber`: Extends `User`, adding `pages`, `groups`, and `canMonetize` attributes.
  
  Each class uses private properties, constructors, getters, and a `getInfo()` method to encapsulate user data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS** for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript** for functionality and interactivity.
